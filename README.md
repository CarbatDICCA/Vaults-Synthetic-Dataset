# Vaults-Synthetic-Dataset
In this repository it is possible to download the dataset of synthetic vaults (barrel vault, pavilion vault, ribbed vault, mirror vault) created using specific Grasshopper algorithms.
The procedural modelling approach, here adopted, follows the ideal geometries, according to the rules of descriptive geometry and relating to the generation of ruled surfaces (directrix and generator).
In order to provide suitable dimensions in line with the masonry architecture, the room geometry was set with sides A and B both ranging from 2 to 5 m. Each side is increased by 0.1 m; this setting guarantees the generation of synthetic vaults with significant differences in the resulting geometries.
Below are the images with indication of the parameters used in the attached Grasshopper files
